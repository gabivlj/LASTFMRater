# Grampy, a music social network!

<img src="./logo/grampy-logo.png" alt="Logolastfm" width="250" height="250">

## Rate your favorite music, share your reviews and rating with other people!

### Using Lastfm database, Go/mux, Node.js, Express.js, Mongodb and React.js.

I chose this tech stack because it's what I'm confortable with.

### Why a music rater?

A: Because current music pages for that purpose are not that good.
Sonemic is not gonna be released anytime soon, of course I chose this project because I like music and challenges.

### When will it be available for use?

I don't know, when it has the features that I think it needs as a MINIMUM, I will publish it.
